            <h2 class="title"> Why We Did It </h2>
            <p class="body">A lot of students are found to have issues in terms of concentration when it comes to getting school work done. <br> Due to this issue, a lot are found to end up with bad grades and little to no motivation to attend class.
                With covid making classes online, those struggling in school are having a much harder time now, as well as those who can't learn online and need to be in class physically in order to retain information. 
                This is why we decided to create this website, in order to help people around the world study and get the help of others to succeed in their classes and thrive academically.<br>
                You can go in multiple study rooms and go into groups in order to study and keep each other motivated, possibly even providing help for those in need. There's also tips you can try out while studying.
                If you wish to remain alone while doing your work, you can plug in to our music rooms and get everything done there!
